This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

### `npm install`

The first step is to download all project dependencies, running inside the project folder:

```
npm install
```

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

### android

At the moment, the project was tested in Android only, using a Redmi 5 Plus with android 7.0.
